The trajectory details the evolution of an application from a basic subscription system to a full-fledged dating app, handled by an AI engineer. Initially, the AI engineer developed an annual subscription model with a 14-day free trial, including authentication, user registration, and a terms of service agreement. A significant portion of the early work involved troubleshooting deployment issues on Vercel and Render, stemming from incorrect environment configurations and a mismatched GitHub repository.

Following user feedback, the project pivoted dramatically from a subscription service to a comprehensive dating application. The AI engineer then embarked on building core dating app features, including a detailed profile setup flow, a discover/swipe mechanism, explore categories, and a robust navigation system, drawing heavily from UI/UX references provided by the user (Tinder/Badoo images). The work is currently in progress, with the backend for likes/matches and dummy profiles implemented, and the frontend for the home page, card swipe, explore, and navigation actively being developed. The engineer also addressed several iterative requests like automatic location and removal of specific text.

<product_requirements>
Initially, the user requested an annual subscription system costing 33 CHF/month (396 CHF annually), with free registration, mandatory payment information collected at signup (but charged after 14 days), and agreement to terms of service via a checkbox. The system needed a welcome page outlining the trial period and a basic user dashboard. Key terms (refund, privacy, payment) were to be detailed. Later, specific refinements included: making the Terms and Conditions a clear blue link, removing PayPal fields from registration, implementing comprehensive identity verification, and moving explicit payment details solely to the terms. Further, the user requested removing payment information from the registration page entirely, prompting for it only after the trial, and removing Made with Emergent branding.

The project then pivoted to a full dating application. Requirements expanded to include: a complete profile system (photos, detailed info like height, hobbies, search preferences), discovery/matching (swipe functionality, smart matching), chat system, and integrated paid features (premium offers). User-provided images from Tinder and Badoo guided the UI/UX for profile setup (one question per page, progress bars, diverse options), card swipe, explore categories, bottom navigation, premium tiers (Gold, Platinum), and detailed permissions (camera, location with interactive map). The application also needs to support global users with language detection and manual selection, along with numerous realistic dummy profiles.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively developing the core features of the dating application. The work has progressed to approximately 90% completion for the current phase, which focuses on the fundamental architecture and UI components based on the extensive image references provided by the user.

**Backend Development:**
- New MongoDB models (, ) have been added to handle user interactions and successful matches.
- Core API endpoints for the dating app are implemented, including:
    - : To record user swipes (like, pass, super like).
    - : To retrieve a user's successful matches.
    - : To show profiles a user has liked.
    - : To show profiles that have liked the current user.
    - : An improved API to fetch profiles for discovery, excluding those already swiped on.
- The  was utilized to source professional images for creating a large number (100+) of global dummy profiles, which will be integrated into the backend.

**Frontend Development:**
- Work is heavily underway on the main frontend pages.
- The **HomePage** with a card swipe component and associated animations is being built.
- The **Bottom Navigation** bar with 5 tabs (Home, Explore, Likes, Chat, Profile) is being implemented.
- The **Explore page** with its distinctive colored, filter-based cards is under construction.
- The **Matches page** is also being worked on.
- General updates to  for routing and integrating these new pages are in progress.
The aim is to deliver a fully functional dating app user interface and backend interactions for the core features.
